# 🌟 **Adding Topics and Knowledge Articles to Create an Engaging Experience Cloud Portal**

---

## 💬 1. Friendly Introduction  
Welcome back, Trailblazer! 👋  
Your Experience Cloud site is almost ready to shine — now it’s time to bring **life and knowledge** into it.  

💡 *Imagine your Experience Cloud site as a magazine — each article, topic, and image adds color, depth, and engagement.*  
In this session, we’ll learn how to **add Knowledge Articles, organize them by Topics, and feature them beautifully** on your site.

---

## 🧠 2. Business Context & Real-World Need  
Every great customer experience thrives on **organized, accessible information**.  
By structuring your content into Topics and Featured Sections, you:  
- 🧭 Help users find answers faster.  
- 💬 Reduce support case volume.  
- 📈 Build engagement through easy navigation.  
- 🌐 Present your brand as clear, reliable, and user-focused.  

✨ *In short: Topics turn scattered information into a guided customer journey.*

---

## ⚙️ 3. Core Concept (Simplified Explanation)  
**Topics** in Salesforce are like digital folders or categories that group related articles together.  
When you connect **Knowledge Articles** to these topics, they can be displayed as **Trending Articles**, **Featured Topics**, or **Popular Sections** on your Experience Cloud homepage.

💬 *Think of Topics as neatly labeled shelves in your online store — each one guiding visitors to what they need.*

## 🧩 4. Key Components & Configurations  

### 🧱 Step 1: Create Topics  
1️⃣ Go to **Content Management → Topics**.  
2️⃣ Add your key categories, e.g.:
   - **Customer Support**
   - **Upcoming Products**
   - **New Features**  
3️⃣ Save each topic — these will later connect your articles to the site.

---

### 🔑 Step 2: Link Knowledge Articles to Topics  
1️⃣ Go to **Article Management**.  
2️⃣ Open each article and assign it to a relevant Topic:
   - “When will iPhone 14 cases be available?” → *Upcoming Products*  
   - “How to send back a damaged iPhone case?” → *Customer Support*  
   - “Can I customize my iPhone case?” → *New Features*  
   - “How long does delivery take?” → *Customer Support*  
3️⃣ Save each article with its assigned Topic.

💬 *This simple link makes your content visible on the Experience Cloud site.*

## 💣 5. Common Challenges or Misconfigurations  
🚫 Forgetting to tag articles with Topics → they won’t appear on the site.  
🚫 Using copyrighted images → risk of takedown.
