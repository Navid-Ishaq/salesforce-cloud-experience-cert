# 🧭 **Adding Navigational Topics in Salesforce Experience Cloud — Guiding Users Through Meaningful Content Paths**

---

## 💬 1. Friendly Introduction  
Welcome, Trailblazer! 👋  
Your Experience Cloud site is coming alive — articles, featured topics, and a vibrant layout.  
Now it’s time to add the final layer of clarity: **Navigational Topics**.  

💡 *Think of navigational topics as the signboards inside a shopping mall — they don’t just display content, they guide visitors exactly where they want to go.*

---

## 🧠 2. Business Context & Real-World Need  
Every successful portal depends on one thing — **easy navigation**.  
Customers should instantly find the right information without confusion.  

Adding **navigational topics** ensures:  
- 🧭 **Clear content hierarchy** — users understand where each article belongs.  
- 💬 **Better search relevance** — articles appear under appropriate topic filters.  
- 🌍 **Enhanced self-service** — customers find solutions faster.  

✨ *Good navigation = happy, self-sufficient users.*

---

## ⚙️ 3. Core Concept (Simplified Explanation)  
**Navigational Topics** are custom categories displayed under your site’s “Topics” tab.  
They act like folders that group related **Knowledge Articles** and **Discussions**.  

💬 *If “Featured Topics” attract attention, “Navigational Topics” organize it.*  
Visitors can browse, filter, or post questions under these structured sections.

---

## 🧩 4. Key Components & Configurations  

### 🧱 Step 1: Access Content Management  
1️⃣ Go to **Experience Builder → Content Management**.  
2️⃣ Click on the **Topics** tab.  
3️⃣ You’ll see previously added **Featured Topics** — now you’ll add new **Navigational Topics**.  

---

### 🧭 Step 2: Add Navigational Topics  
Create meaningful categories that match your content and audience needs.  
For example:  
- 💡 **Features** — to group how-to or feature explanation articles.  
- 📦 **Products** — to showcase product-related FAQs.  
- 💬 **Support** — for customer queries or troubleshooting guides.  

👉 Click **Add**, type the topic name, and hit **Save**.  
You’ve now created three clear navigation channels for your site.

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Verify Navigation on the Site  
Go back to your site and **refresh** the page.  
You’ll now notice a 🔽 dropdown next to the **Topics tab**, displaying:  
- Features  
- Products  
- Support  

🎉 These act as your main navigation topics, ready to link to articles and discussions.

---

### 🧾 Step 4: Assign Articles to Navigational Topics  
Now that your topics exist, it’s time to fill them with content.  

1️⃣ Go to **Content Management → Article Management**.  
2️⃣ Open a published article.  
3️⃣ Scroll to the **Topics** section.  
4️⃣ Assign one or more navigational topics (e.g., *Features* or *Support*).  
5️⃣ Hit **Save**.  

💬 *Each article can belong to multiple topics — just like a blog tagged under different categories.*

---

### 🧩 Step 5: Refresh and Test  
Go back to your live site and open the **Topics tab** again.  
- Under **Features**, you’ll see articles tagged “Features.”  
- Under **Support**, you’ll see customer support-related articles.  
- Under **Products**, you’ll find product updates and upcoming launches.  

Everything now appears neat, organized, and user-friendly. ✨

## 💣 5. Common Challenges or Misconfigurations  
🚫 Topics not appearing in the dropdown → Not saved under navigational topics.  
🚫 Articles not showing → Articles not tagged correctly.

## 🧰 6. Consultant Tips & Best Practices  
🔹 Limit navigational topics to 3–5 for clarity.

🔹 Keep “Featured Topics” for promotions and “Navigational Topics” for structure.  
🔹 Test topic filters in both desktop and mobile view.  

💡 *Balance structure with simplicity — too many categories can overwhelm users.*
